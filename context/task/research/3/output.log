I've completed the research for adding a Hello World script in Python. The proposed implementation follows Python best practices with a main function and proper entry point guard. The script is ready to be created as `hello_world.py` with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
