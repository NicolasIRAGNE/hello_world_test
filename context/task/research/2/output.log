## Research Complete

I've completed the research phase for Issue #71 (Add hello world in python):

### Key Findings:
1. **Repository Structure**: Minimal repository with only a test file, no existing Python code
2. **Implementation Location**: Root directory is the best location for `hello_world.py`
3. **Python Best Practices**: Designed a simple, idiomatic Python hello world implementation with:
   - Shebang line for direct execution
   - Module docstring
   - Main function pattern
   - Guard clause for import safety

### Proposed Implementation:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""A simple Hello World program in Python."""

def main():
    """Main function that prints Hello World."""
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The research is complete and ready for the coding phase where the actual file will be created and tested.
