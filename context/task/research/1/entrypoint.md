# 85-research-1 - Research: Add simple button that says HELLO GUYS

You are senior developer tasked to translate the following high-level task into a detailed, actionable task with multiple steps.

The issue is located at `context/task/85-research-1.json`.

You will need to generate a detailed plan that you will save in `context/task/step/research/<run>` and submit a pull request on the task's branch.

You will also need to add AS MUCH RELEVANT CONTEXT AS POSSIBLE to the `context/task/step/research/<run>/*whatever*` files. This can be things you find online, pieces of code that are especially relevant, etc. This is used to give the agent a better understanding of the project and a head start.
