## Research Complete

I've completed the research phase for Issue #91. Here's a summary of my findings:

**Task**: Add a button that says "HELLO GUYS" that is big, round, funny, and speaks German.

**Key Findings**:
- The project uses **Popek**, a custom GUI programming language (`.ppk` files)
- Currently a greenfield project with no existing Popek implementation
- Need to create a `main.ppk` file with a large, round button

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create a centered window with a prominent button
- Style the button with:
  - Large dimensions (200x200 for circular appearance)
  - Round shape using `borderRadius`
  - Bright, playful colors (yellow/orange)
  - Large, bold text
- Add German interaction on click (display German greetings like "Hallo Leute!")

The research phase is complete and ready for the coding phase to implement the button according to these specifications.
