## Research Complete

The research phase for Issue #75 (Add hello world in Python) is complete. The repository needs a simple Python hello world implementation. Currently, there are no Python files in the repository.

To implement this task in the next phase (coding), create a `hello_world.py` file with a basic Python hello world program.
