## Research Complete

I've completed the research phase for implementing a funny "Hello World" in Python. Here's what I've determined:

### Recommendation: Over-engineered Enterprise Edition

The best approach is to create an intentionally over-complicated "Hello World" application that:
- Uses FastAPI for a full REST API
- Implements a state machine with the `transitions` library 
- Features enterprise-grade logging, metrics, and health checks
- Includes dramatic phases like "initializing", "contemplating", and "preparing" before finally greeting

This approach:
- ✅ Aligns with all project requirements (Python 3.11+, FastAPI, transitions, strict typing)
- ✅ Creates humor through absurd complexity for a simple task
- ✅ Demonstrates all required technologies
- ✅ Provides educational value while being entertaining

The implementation will include features like correlation IDs, subsystem health checks, greeting performance metrics, and overly formal corporate language - all for printing "Hello, World!"

The research findings have been documented and the implementation plan is ready for the coding phase.
