## Implementation Complete

I've successfully created a Popek application (`main.ppk`) that implements all the requirements from Issue #91:

### âœ… Completed Features:
1. **Big Round Button** - 300x300 pixels, perfectly circular
2. **"HELLO GUYS" Text** - Large, bold, prominently displayed
3. **Funny Design** - Bright gold background with hot pink text and border
4. **German Speaking** - Cycles through 6 German greetings with emojis when clicked

The application creates a centered 500x500 window with a playful, eye-catching button that delivers German greetings in a fun way, meeting all specified requirements.
