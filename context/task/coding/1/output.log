## Summary

I've completed the coding task for Issue #91. The implementation creates a Popek application with:

- **A big, round button** (300x300 pixels, perfectly circular)
- **"HELLO GUYS" text** displayed prominently on the button
- **Funny design** with bright gold background and hot pink text/border
- **German speaking functionality** that cycles through 6 different German greetings when clicked

The code follows the Popek language specification and includes proper state management for the greeting rotation. Each click displays a different German phrase with accompanying emojis for added personality.
