## Summary

I've prepared the Python hello world script for issue #75. The script needs to be saved as `hello_world.py` with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello, World!")
```

However, I need write permissions to create the file in the repository. Once permissions are granted, the file can be created and tested by running `python3 hello_world.py` which should output "Hello, World!".
