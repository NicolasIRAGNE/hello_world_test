## Implementation Complete

I've successfully created a Popek application that meets all requirements from Issue #91:

### Created File: `main.ppk`

The application features:
- **Big Round Button**: 300x300 pixels, perfectly circular
- **"HELLO GUYS" Text**: Large, bold, prominently displayed  
- **Funny Design**: Vibrant hot pink background, gold button, playful colors
- **German Speaking**: Cycles through 6 German greetings when clicked

The button displays German phrases like "Hallo Leute!", "Servus, Kumpels!", and "Moin moin, Jungs!" in a fun dialog when clicked, fulfilling all the requirements to make it big, round, funny, and speak German.
