# Implementation Plan - Donut Button Feature

## Overview
Create a Popek GUI application with a button displaying "i want some donuts haha" that shows Homer Simpson facts when clicked.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Application Structure
1. **Create main.ppk file**
   - Location: `/tmp/moat/ef6eff2a/main.ppk`
   - Define app with name "Homer's Donut Paradise"
   - Set up window container with appropriate dimensions

### Phase 2: Implement UI Components
2. **Add the Donut Button**
   - Text: "i want some donuts haha" (exact as specified)
   - Styling: Pink background (#FF1493) to resemble donut frosting
   - Size: 250x50 pixels with rounded corners
   - Position: Centered in container

3. **Add Fact Display Area**
   - Text component for displaying Homer facts
   - Initial text: "Click the button for a Homer Simpson fact!"
   - Proper text wrapping for longer facts

### Phase 3: Implement Functionality
4. **Create Fact Array**
   - Store 5 Homer Simpson facts
   - Implement selection logic

5. **Add Click Handler**
   - onclick event for button
   - Update text component with random fact
   - Use Popek's state management features

### Phase 4: Styling and Polish
6. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Add appropriate padding and spacing
   - Ensure responsive layout
   - Consider adding donut-themed colors

## Code Structure

```popek
app "Homer's Donut Paradise" {
    # State variables
    state facts = [
        "Homer once ate 64 slices of American cheese in one sitting!",
        "Homer's favorite donut is the pink frosted with sprinkles!",
        "Homer has held 188 different jobs throughout the series!",
        "Homer's middle name is Jay!",
        "D'oh! was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2001!"
    ]
    state currentFactIndex = 0
    
    window {
        # Window configuration
        container {
            # UI components
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Button displays correct text
- [ ] Button is clickable
- [ ] Facts display correctly when clicked
- [ ] Facts rotate through all options
- [ ] UI is visually appealing
- [ ] Application runs without errors

## Success Criteria
1. Button with exact text "i want some donuts haha" is visible
2. Clicking button displays Homer Simpson facts
3. Application follows Popek language conventions
4. Code is clean and maintainable

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Popek compiler not available | Document manual testing approach |
| State management complexity | Keep implementation simple with basic array |
| Unknown Popek limitations | Refer to specification in stack.md |

## Estimated Timeline
- Application structure: 5 minutes
- UI implementation: 10 minutes
- Functionality: 10 minutes
- Testing and refinement: 5 minutes

Total: ~30 minutes

## Notes
- The typo "homer simsons" in the original request will be corrected to "Homer Simpson"
- Pink color scheme chosen to match donut frosting theme
- Facts chosen are fun and family-friendly

# Research Findings - Donut Button Task

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: ef6eff2a  
**Objective**: Add a button that says "i want some donuts haha" and include a fact about Homer Simpson

## Current Codebase Analysis

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Popek (.ppk) - A declarative GUI programming language
- **Framework**: Native Popek GUI framework
- **Current State**: No existing implementation files found

### Key Findings
1. The codebase currently has no `main.ppk` file (required entry point)
2. Popek language specification is fully documented in `openmoat/context/tech/stack.md`
3. No existing UI components or button implementations to reference
4. We'll be creating the application from scratch

## Popek Button Syntax
Based on the specification, buttons in Popek follow this pattern:
```popek
button "Button Text" {
    width: number
    height: number
    background: color
    color: color
    fontSize: number
    borderRadius: number
    
    onclick: {
        # Action code
    }
}
```

## Homer Simpson Facts (for implementation)
Selected facts that can be randomly displayed:
1. "Homer once ate 64 slices of American cheese in one sitting!"
2. "Homer's favorite donut is the pink frosted with sprinkles!"
3. "Homer has held 188 different jobs throughout the series!"
4. "Homer's middle name is Jay!"
5. "D'oh! was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2001 thanks to Homer!"

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### File Structure
```
/tmp/moat/ef6eff2a/
├── main.ppk          # Main application file (to be created)
└── [existing files]
```

### Implementation Plan
1. Create `main.ppk` with basic Popek app structure
2. Add a window container with vertical layout
3. Implement the donut button with pink styling (like donut frosting)
4. Add text element to display Homer facts
5. Implement onclick handler to randomly display facts

### Sample Implementation Structure
```popek
app "Homer's Donut Paradise" {
    window {
        title: "Mmm... Donuts!"
        width: 500
        height: 400
        centered: true
        
        container {
            layout: vertical
            padding: 30
            spacing: 20
            align: center
            
            # Donut button
            button "i want some donuts haha" {
                width: 250
                height: 50
                background: #FF1493  # Deep pink like donut frosting
                color: white
                fontSize: 18
                borderRadius: 25
                
                onclick: {
                    # Display random Homer fact
                    set homerFact.content = randomFact()
                }
            }
            
            # Homer fact display
            text homerFact {
                content: "Click the button for a Homer Simpson fact!"
                size: 16
                align: center
                color: #333
                wrap: true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Potential Challenges
1. **No existing build system**: Need to ensure Popek compiler is available
2. **State management**: Need to implement random fact selection logic
3. **Testing**: No existing test framework identified

## Dependencies
- Popek compiler (`popek build` command)
- Popek runtime (`popek run` command)

## Next Steps
1. Create `main.ppk` file with the donut button implementation
2. Implement random fact display functionality
3. Test the application using Popek tools
4. Document any build/run instructions

## Conclusion
The task is straightforward - we need to create a new Popek application from scratch with a single button that displays Homer Simpson facts when clicked. The Popek language specification provides clear syntax guidelines, making implementation feasible despite the lack of existing code examples in the repository.
