# Implementation Plan - Donut Button Feature

## Overview
Create a Popek GUI application with a button displaying "i want some donuts haha" that shows Homer Simpson facts when clicked.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Application Structure
1. **Create main.ppk file**
   - Location: `/tmp/moat/ef6eff2a/main.ppk`
   - Define app with name "Homer's Donut Paradise"
   - Set up window container with appropriate dimensions

### Phase 2: Implement UI Components
2. **Add the Donut Button**
   - Text: "i want some donuts haha" (exact as specified)
   - Styling: Pink background (#FF1493) to resemble donut frosting
   - Size: 250x50 pixels with rounded corners
   - Position: Centered in container

3. **Add Fact Display Area**
   - Text component for displaying Homer facts
   - Initial text: "Click the button for a Homer Simpson fact!"
   - Proper text wrapping for longer facts

### Phase 3: Implement Functionality
4. **Create Fact Array**
   - Store 5 Homer Simpson facts
   - Implement selection logic

5. **Add Click Handler**
   - onclick event for button
   - Update text component with random fact
   - Use Popek's state management features

### Phase 4: Styling and Polish
6. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Add appropriate padding and spacing
   - Ensure responsive layout
   - Consider adding donut-themed colors

## Code Structure

```popek
app "Homer's Donut Paradise" {
    # State variables
    state facts = [
        "Homer once ate 64 slices of American cheese in one sitting!",
        "Homer's favorite donut is the pink frosted with sprinkles!",
        "Homer has held 188 different jobs throughout the series!",
        "Homer's middle name is Jay!",
        "D'oh! was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2001!"
    ]
    state currentFactIndex = 0
    
    window {
        # Window configuration
        container {
            # UI components
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Button displays correct text
- [ ] Button is clickable
- [ ] Facts display correctly when clicked
- [ ] Facts rotate through all options
- [ ] UI is visually appealing
- [ ] Application runs without errors

## Success Criteria
1. Button with exact text "i want some donuts haha" is visible
2. Clicking button displays Homer Simpson facts
3. Application follows Popek language conventions
4. Code is clean and maintainable

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Popek compiler not available | Document manual testing approach |
| State management complexity | Keep implementation simple with basic array |
| Unknown Popek limitations | Refer to specification in stack.md |

## Estimated Timeline
- Application structure: 5 minutes
- UI implementation: 10 minutes
- Functionality: 10 minutes
- Testing and refinement: 5 minutes

Total: ~30 minutes

## Notes
- The typo "homer simsons" in the original request will be corrected to "Homer Simpson"
- Pink color scheme chosen to match donut frosting theme
- Facts chosen are fun and family-friendly
