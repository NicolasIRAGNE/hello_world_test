# Research Findings - Donut Button Task

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: ef6eff2a  
**Objective**: Add a button that says "i want some donuts haha" and include a fact about Homer Simpson

## Current Codebase Analysis

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Popek (.ppk) - A declarative GUI programming language
- **Framework**: Native Popek GUI framework
- **Current State**: No existing implementation files found

### Key Findings
1. The codebase currently has no `main.ppk` file (required entry point)
2. Popek language specification is fully documented in `openmoat/context/tech/stack.md`
3. No existing UI components or button implementations to reference
4. We'll be creating the application from scratch

## Popek Button Syntax
Based on the specification, buttons in Popek follow this pattern:
```popek
button "Button Text" {
    width: number
    height: number
    background: color
    color: color
    fontSize: number
    borderRadius: number
    
    onclick: {
        # Action code
    }
}
```

## Homer Simpson Facts (for implementation)
Selected facts that can be randomly displayed:
1. "Homer once ate 64 slices of American cheese in one sitting!"
2. "Homer's favorite donut is the pink frosted with sprinkles!"
3. "Homer has held 188 different jobs throughout the series!"
4. "Homer's middle name is Jay!"
5. "D'oh! was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2001 thanks to Homer!"

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### File Structure
```
/tmp/moat/ef6eff2a/
├── main.ppk          # Main application file (to be created)
└── [existing files]
```

### Implementation Plan
1. Create `main.ppk` with basic Popek app structure
2. Add a window container with vertical layout
3. Implement the donut button with pink styling (like donut frosting)
4. Add text element to display Homer facts
5. Implement onclick handler to randomly display facts

### Sample Implementation Structure
```popek
app "Homer's Donut Paradise" {
    window {
        title: "Mmm... Donuts!"
        width: 500
        height: 400
        centered: true
        
        container {
            layout: vertical
            padding: 30
            spacing: 20
            align: center
            
            # Donut button
            button "i want some donuts haha" {
                width: 250
                height: 50
                background: #FF1493  # Deep pink like donut frosting
                color: white
                fontSize: 18
                borderRadius: 25
                
                onclick: {
                    # Display random Homer fact
                    set homerFact.content = randomFact()
                }
            }
            
            # Homer fact display
            text homerFact {
                content: "Click the button for a Homer Simpson fact!"
                size: 16
                align: center
                color: #333
                wrap: true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Potential Challenges
1. **No existing build system**: Need to ensure Popek compiler is available
2. **State management**: Need to implement random fact selection logic
3. **Testing**: No existing test framework identified

## Dependencies
- Popek compiler (`popek build` command)
- Popek runtime (`popek run` command)

## Next Steps
1. Create `main.ppk` file with the donut button implementation
2. Implement random fact display functionality
3. Test the application using Popek tools
4. Document any build/run instructions

## Conclusion
The task is straightforward - we need to create a new Popek application from scratch with a single button that displays Homer Simpson facts when clicked. The Popek language specification provides clear syntax guidelines, making implementation feasible despite the lack of existing code examples in the repository.
